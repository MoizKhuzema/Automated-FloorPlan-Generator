There are two models:
- The first model (in model folder) creates a bubble diagram of the rooms and maps them to a floor plan based on dimension limitation and the Chinese Ethical Code for room layout.

- The second model (in Extra Material folder) creates a floor plan based on dimension limitation and the Chinese Ethical Code for room layout based of squarified Treemap algorithm. Find the research paper at https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijcgt/2010/624817/
